      She says that I should eat vegetables if I want to be strong, when I grow
      up. I didn’t what that one meant, so I asked her. She said that if you a
      good to people, they will be good to you. If you do bad things, then bad
      things will come back to you. My mother is always giving me advice. She
      says that a penny saved is a penny earned.

    <p class="b">
      I am still thingning about that one. Some of these things are difficult to
      understand. My mother is very wise. (мудрый-müdrık) She says that she has
      learned from her mistakes. She tells me that she would like me not to make
      mistakes, but she says that evryone does make mistakes. The important
      thing is that we learn from our mistakes. My mother says that nobody is
      perfect.

      My mother tells my sister that time is precious. My mother has a lot of
      common sense. I hope I am as wise as she is when I have children of my
      own. Sometimes I wish that she would not give me so much advice. I think
      that I know what I’m doing.

    <p class="e">
      But in the end, I always remember what sha has said and I try to live by
      the standards that she has set for me. Take the advice that your parents
      give you. They only have your best interests at heart. I could never
      surprise my mother, but she often surprises me. She has always known what
      I wanted and tried to get it for me.

    <p class="f">
      My sister wastes time and my mother doesn’t like that. My mother tells me
      to be true to myself. She says that I should notfollow the crowd. I should
      listen to my own conscience and do what i thing right. She says that it
      doesn’t matter if you fail at something, the important thing is that you
      try. If you’re done your best, then that is all that matters. I listen to
      my mother; I think she gives very good advice.
